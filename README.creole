=Hibernate Conversation Utils=

Filter and CurrentSessionContext implementations used to create a cookie-based 
conversation with Hibernate i.e. a cookie that will be used to retrieve a previously
created Hibernate Session to be used during serveral requests from the same
user.

This to avoid IllegalStateExceptions and problems related with Spring's 
HibernateTransactionManager thread-bound Sessions.
